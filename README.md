# Automatically Generate Objects Tool in Unity
This tool was created to help with the creation of one of the nine scenes in the Impression of the Sun VR project. In this specific scene, we wanted to generate a large number of different objects with varying 3D models, colors, and materials based on an input RGB map where green is the color where we want to have objects.

## How to Use
Given the number of different 3D models you originally built, given the various materials you want to apply to the models, and input an RGB picture into the Unity Inspector. Then press the Generate button. If you are dissatisfied with the layout you generated this time, click the Destroy button and click the Generate button again. The distance between each object is determined at random during each generation.
